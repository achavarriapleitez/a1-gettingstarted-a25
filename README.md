Amanda Chavarria Pleitez [add render link]

This project shows information about myself such as my name, major, class, hobbies, things I am looking forward to, my mouse, and experiences/skills.

Technical Achievements:
    - Styled page with CSS:
        - Added rules for the body, ul, img, and p b selectors.
            -  I used w3schools HTML <b> Tag page to figure out that I could use p b to target paragraph tags that were bolded and add a different color to them specifically.
            - I used w3schools to get rid of the bullet marker for my unordered lists. I had no idea this was possible so it was fun to learn!
        - Added rules for my .grid-container, .picture-container, and .banner classes.
        - Added an @media to collapse the grid-container(for my experience) to 1 col for smaller screens in an attempt to make my website somewhat responsive :,)

    - Added in a JS Animation:
        - Added in a simple typing animation in the <head> of my html and function runs for 150 milliseconds once the page has loaded in.

    - Added in additional HTML tags such as images, divs, and brs.
    - Added in classes/ids to specifically design specific elements on my site. 

Design Achievements:
    - Used the Figtree Font from Google Fonts: I used Figtree as the primary font for my site's text.
    - Created a Color Palette on Adobe and added all the colors to my site.
